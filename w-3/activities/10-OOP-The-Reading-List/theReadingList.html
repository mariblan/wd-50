      <h1>JS OOP – The Reading List</h1>
      <h5><i>An object-oriented book-list!</i></h5>
      <div class="list-container">
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Create a class BookList</li>
          <li>Create another class called Book</li>
          <li>
            BookLists should have the following properties:
            <ul class="list">
              <li>An array of all the Books</li>
              <li>Number of books marked as read</li>
              <li>Number of books marked not read yet</li>
              <li>A reference to the next book to read (book object)</li>
              <li>A reference to the current book being read (book object)</li>
              <li>A reference to the last book read (book object)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Each Book should have several properties:
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Genre</li>
              <li>Author</li>
              <li>Read (true or false)</li>
              <li>
                Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"
                  >JS Date() object</a
                >
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Every Booklist should have a few methods:
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                .add(book)
                <ul>
                  <li>should add a book to the books list.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                .finishCurrentBook()
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>
                    should mark the book that is currently being read as “read”
                  </li>
                  <li>Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())</li>
                  <li>
                    Change the last book read to be the book that just got
                    finished
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Change the current book to be the next book to be read
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Change the next book to be read property to be the first
                    unread book you find in the list of books
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Try to think
            of more that might be useful.
          </li>
        </ul>
