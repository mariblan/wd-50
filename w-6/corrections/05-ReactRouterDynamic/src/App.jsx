          For this exercise, you will have to:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The BrowserRouter is already imported for you in <b>index.js</b>,
              take a moment and have a look on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a component named {'<Student>'} that will display{' '}
              <b>Hello [id from the parameter]!</b> and add it to the {'<App>'}{' '}
              component. (Don't forget to import this new component in your
              App.js file)
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a second component named {'<Results>'} that will display{' '}
              <b>No results for [name from the parameter]!</b> and add it to the{' '}
              {'<App>'} component. (Don't forget to import this new component in
              your App.js file)
            </li>
            <li>
              The navigation is already created for you, take a moment and have
              a look on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, create a {'<Routes>'} component with two routes in it. One
              for each component (Student & Results).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <a
