# Creating your first React Vite app

You can find more information in the vite documentation Getting started -> https://v3.vitejs.dev/guide/

1.  Creating a React Vite app repository when there is no repository yet.

    1.1. Open the terminal in vs code and navigate to the "01-YourFirstReactApp" folder.

    1.2. Run the code "npm create vite@latest" to kickstart your application and will prompt you to:

    - 1.2.1\. Give the name of your repository. Do so an press enter.

    - 1.2.2\. Give the name of your project. Just press enter so it uses the same name as in the repository.

    - 1.2.3\. Give the framework of your application. With the arrows up and down move to "React" and press enter.

    - 1.2.4\. Give the language you will use in the app. With the arrows up and down move to "javascript" and press enter.

    - 1.2.5\. Wait until your app finish the creation process. Once it is done, the terminal will give you the instractions on code you need to run to start your app:

      - cd name-of-reacr-app-folder -> should be the same as the name you gave to your app in step 2.1.

      - npm install -> this will take a few seconds, as is installing all the dependencies and the node modules necesary for your react app to work.

      - npm run dev -> do this once the npm install finishes to create a live server for your react app. The link to the live server will appear in the terminal, so to open it you can copy paste it into the browser, or clicking on the address while pressing ctrl.

2.  Creating a React Vite App inside the repository you are currently located at in the terminal.

    2.1. Open the terminal in vs code and navigate to the "01-YourFirstReactApp" folder.

    2.2. Create a directory with the mkdir command and the name "MyFirstReactAppTrial".

    2.3. cd in that directory.

    2.4. Run the command "npm create vite@latest ."

    - 2.4.1\. the dot at the end of the command will tell the command to not create a new directory for the project but to create the boiler plate right inside the directory the terminal is currently in. That means you will not be ask to give a name to your project folder anymore.

    * 2.4.2\. Give the name of your project. Just press enter so it uses the same name as in the repository.

    * 1.2.3\. Give the framework of your application. With the arrows up and down move to "React" and press enter.

    * 1.2.4\. Give the language you will use in the app. With the arrows up and down move to "javascript" and press enter.

    * 1.2.5\. Wait until your app finish the creation process. Once it is done, the terminal will give you the instractions on code you need to run to start your app:

      - npm install -> this will take a few seconds, as is installing all the dependencies and the node modules necesary for your react app to work.

      - npm run dev -> do this once the npm install finishes to create a live server for your react app. The link to the live server will appear in the terminal, so to open it you can copy paste it into the browser, or clicking on the address while pressing ctrl.
