          <b>SecretSantaChat.js</b>, you have a variable for the gift you'd like

          gift you'd like to receive.

          Your secret santa will give you a random gift back, from the{" "}

            <li>
              <i>"I have received a -your chosen gift-, just what I wanted!"</i>{" "}

              <i>"I got a -item received-"</i> if you were gifted something
